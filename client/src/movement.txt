Membrane lipids are amphipathic; that is they contain both  hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. The hydrophilic (polar)  region of the membrane lipids is their globular head; the hydrophobic (nonpolar)  regions of the membrane lipids is their fatty acid tails. 
The membrane lipids are organized into a continuous bilayer in which the hydrophobic regions of the phospholipids are shielded  from the aqueous environment, while the hydrophilic regions are immersed in water. 
In membrane lipids, proteins are found inserted into this  lipid bilayer and are classified into integral proteins and periph eral proteins. Integral proteins are anchored to membranes through a direct interaction with the lipid bilayer
